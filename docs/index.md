# ESI Documentation
ESI is the name of EVE Online's publicly available API, allowing you to query the game itself to get info about your character, corporation and more. This documentation can be used as a jumping off point to learn how to begin developing against ESI or as a place to learn some of the ESI concepts that are harder to grasp.

We appreciate help from the EVE Online community and encourage pull requests if you feel any documentation is missing.
